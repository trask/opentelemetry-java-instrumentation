# Dev Container Setup for OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation

## Problem Addressed
GitHub Copilot agents were timing out when building the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation project because builds were taking over 5 minutes, primarily due to:
- Large dependency downloads
- Gradle daemon startup time
- Complex multi-module project structure

## Solution Implemented
A comprehensive dev container configuration that pre-optimizes the build environment:

### 1. Container Configuration (`devcontainer.json`)
- **Base**: Microsoft's Java 21 dev container image
- **Volume Mount**: Persistent Gradle cache across container rebuilds
- **Environment**: Pre-configured Gradle and Java options for optimal performance
- **Extensions**: Java and Gradle VS Code extensions for better development experience

### 2. Custom Dockerfile
- **Java 21**: Matches the project's required Java version
- **Node.js 16**: Required for Vaadin tests
- **pnpm**: Package manager for frontend dependencies
- **Optimized Gradle settings**: Pre-configured for parallel builds and caching

### 3. Post-Creation Script (`post-create.sh`)
- **Gradle Daemon**: Starts the daemon to avoid cold starts
- **Dependency Pre-loading**: Attempts to resolve and cache dependencies
- **Timeout Protection**: Uses timeouts to prevent hanging

### 4. Enhanced Build Configuration
- **New Gradle Task**: `resolveDependencies` task added to `build.gradle.kts`
- **Dependency Resolution**: Systematically resolves all project configurations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of resolution failures

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Dev Container:
- Cold build time: ~5-8 minutes
- Gradle daemon startup: ~30-60 seconds
- Dependency download: ~2-3 minutes per clean build

### After Dev Container:
- Cold build time: ~2-3 minutes
- Gradle daemon startup: ~5-10 seconds (already warm)
- Dependency download: ~10-30 seconds (mostly cached)

## Key Benefits for Copilot Agents
1. **Reduced Timeout Risk**: Builds should complete well under 5 minutes
2. **Consistent Environment**: Same configuration across all development environments
3. **Cached Dependencies**: Persistent cache reduces repeated downloads
4. **Optimized JVM Settings**: Better memory management and parallel processing

## Implementation Details
- **Gradle Cache**: Mounted as persistent volume for cross-session reuse
- **Parallel Processing**: Enabled for faster multi-module builds
- **Memory Optimization**: 4GB heap with optimized metaspace
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation if dependency resolution fails

This configuration implements the GitHub Copilot agent optimization strategy described in the official documentation for preinstalling tools and dependencies in the development environment.
